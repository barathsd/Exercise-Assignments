Tried starting IIS service, but was getting error

Treid to start the Default app pool 

But got 5059 id error:

Application pool DefaultAppPool has been disabled. Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) encountered a failure when it started a worker process to serve the application pool.

Changed the Identity of DefaultAppPool to ApplicationPoolIdentity and restarted IIS.

Now we are not getting 503 error when we go to localhost
